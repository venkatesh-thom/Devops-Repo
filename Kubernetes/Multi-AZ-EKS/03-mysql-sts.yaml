  podManagementPolicy: OrderedReady  # Start pods one after another (recommended for DBs)

  # - OrderedReady: (default) ensures each pod starts only after the previous one is Running and Ready.
  # - Parallel: allows all pods to start or terminate at the same time (faster but not suitable for DBs requiring startup order).
